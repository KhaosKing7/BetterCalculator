# BetterCalculator
## Planned features:
1: A full blown normal calculator that does calculator stuff, the main goal for this feature is to be able to type in an expression, for example: 1+4(6/2) and calculate it in one step without seperating each operation to be done manually one by one.(wip)

2: A section to allow you to input values for a formula such as the pythagurous theorom, area of a shape ect, and calculate it for you while telling you each unknown value that you gave. (started but not done)
